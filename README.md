## Abstract  
The island of Oronsay, with its cluster of shell midden sites, plays a pivotal role in the study of the Scottish Mesolithic. However, recent research, particularly on its seasonal occupation, remains limited. This lack of investigation is problematic, as the site cluster has been used to suggest near-sedentary mobility among hunter-gatherers, yet the evidence base—primarily fish remains—for this year-round occupation remains heavily debated.  

With recent advancements in sclerochronological techniques—studying the physical and chemical properties of hard tissues to reconstruct life histories and environmental conditions—these issues can now be addressed with more accuracy and on a higher chronological resolution. New research using **Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS)** shows the potential of using limpets, the dominant species in the Oronsay shell middens, as a high-resolution source for seasonality data. This innovative approach will reveal seasonal temperature changes recorded in the shells, allowing us to determine each specimen's time of death and, consequently, the season of collection.  

To renew the study of Oronsay and the seasonal use of its shell middens, we are planning new research on the island. This involves targeted excavations planned for July and August 2025, in which we aim to locate dense deposits of limpet shells and to analyse them using LIBS. The preliminary results of this analysis will be presented.

## Outcomes  
Using **Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS)**, this study generated high-resolution (<50 μm) elemental datasets from 85 limpet shell specimens excavated at the [Cnoc Coig](https://www.trove.scot/designation/SM13655) midden, [Oronsay](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8mS4Zs5FjuTWVi3s5). The Mg/Ca distributions captured seasonal temperature changes, enabling precise season-of-death reconstructions.  

Results show that the site was occupied during **all four seasons**, with stratigraphic clustering suggesting multi-seasonal shell accumulation. These findings address the methodological limitations of earlier studies and provide robust evidence for complex seasonal occupation patterns. Future work will integrate seasonality analysis with radiocarbon dating to further refine Mesolithic settlement reconstructions.
